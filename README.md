## Testing

- All links were tested and confirmed to be working properly.
- The website was tested in browsers like Chrome and Safari.
- Texts in each section and on all pages were reviewed to ensure they are readable and understandable.
- Both forms were tested for proper functionality and validation.
- Two bugs that appeared while checking on different devices, like iPhones, were resolved:
    - The dropdown menu had insufficient contrast.
    - The hero text was overlapping with the header.
- Lighthouse optimization was performed to improve Largest Contentful Paint by adding a preload link tag in the head of the page.
